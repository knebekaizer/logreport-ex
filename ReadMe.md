Assumptions
-----------

Below are some additional assumptions that have been made to overcome any
unclear or possibly inconsistent requirements:

0. _Customer ID is a string containing only ASCII characters in a range [A-Z]._ 
However, the example contains lower case letters as well as space and dash. 
    * Allowed characters are: [A-Za-z\-_]
    * Customer ID is case-insensitive
    
Testing
-------
There is a number of unit tests as well as built-in selftest.
